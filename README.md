**Under the hood**<br/>Using Twitter API, tweets are stored in Redis DB. This helps to count even mentions in deleted tweets, as it is a common practice for an influencer to delete it's tweets.

Instead of access via an API, data from database is simply dumped into JSON file, which is publically available at https://storage.zahrevsky.com/twitter-collector/tweets-dumped.sjon. This approach saves a lot of time in development, and is OK, as this tool is not commonly used and doesn't need to be fast or work in real-time.
